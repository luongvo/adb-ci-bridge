CI Bridge Tookit 
==

1. What is this toolkit for?
=======
In an attempt to create a real-time debug tool that could run on any CI servers, can capture failed tests trace and screenshot. I create this. Well, the most `awesome` term here is `realtime`, but sadly to say that I have not completed this part :sosad:

2. Usage 
=======

```shell
git clone git@github.com:toantran-ea/adb-ci-bridge.git && cd adb-ci-bridge/ && ./setup_bridge.sh
```

Done!

3. What is the `science` behind? 
======
